    "description": "Bone and Soft Tissue Augmentation in Implantology addresses useful methods of bone grafting procedures in implant treatment based on current biologic principles and constitutes a unique reference in this field. The book describes, in over 760 pages and 2837 mostly color illustrations, the different possibilities available to augment the bone volume in width and height. The information presented includes not only the underlying scientific concepts of the different augmentation techniques with autogenous bone, but also the associated soft tissue management, from safe approaches to different possibilities for soft tissue augmentation and papilla reconstruction techniques. The book provides surgeons with a basic understanding of the biologic response to bone grafting procedures. Experienced implantologists will benefit from the in-depth background information, details of high-level surgical techniques, and scientific results, which will enable them to optimize their surgical procedures. Each chapter offers a wealth of information on the specific topic covered, with much attention given to the scientific concepts behind each one. Extensive case reports with step-by-step documentation allow readers to gain an impression of what is possible today in the 3D reconstruction procedures of the alveolar crest. Important criteria for success are presented as well as possible complications and their treatment. Bone and Soft Tissue Augmentation in Implantology is a must-read for every implantologist, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, and any dentist interested in surgery.

    "description": "Anatomical textbooks and atlases often fail to meet the clinical demands of defining intraoperative structures for oral implantologists because of the overwhelmingly detailed minutia. Because certain anatomical landmarks are hard to illustrate in a diagram format, students and professionals can be confused when confronted with actual specimens in the dissecting room or in the operatory. This book, however, shows the structures of the maxilla, the mandible, and the nasal cavity as they actually exist in the dissected or live body, through the presentation of cadaver specimens and clinical cases. Several of the chapters include full-page images of specific cadaver sections with all the relevant anatomical parts labeled for convenience. Cone beam computed tomography images are also presented to show how this technology can be used to measure the bone density, the width of the alveolar ridge, and the exact distance available for implant placement under or above certain anatomical landmarks prior to implant selection. This book will simplify the learning and execution of implant-related surgical procedures in a region of the body that presents special topographic and anatomical difficulties.

    "description": "Effective wire bending techniques that are customized to each individual patient make orthodontic treatment more efficient and can reduce treatment time. In lieu of overly complicated wire bending, the author of this manual promotes precise, intuitive bending and presents the proven methods that work with any biologically compatible wire. The essential components and techniques of customized wire bending are detailed step-by-step, including trimming of casts; selection and proper manipulation of pliers; the first-order bends (in or out), second-order bends (up or down), and third-order bends (torque); and optimal methods of adjustment to be used during orthodontic treatment. In addition, the author elucidates the “fourth-order bend,” which is the understanding of how to use a wire effectively to apply orthodontic force to a patient over time. Technical images and case presentations illustrate each step of the process to ensure maximum comprehension. A must-have guide for orthodontic residents and practitioners alike.

    "description": "The minimally invasive philosophy underpinning periodontal and peri-implant microsurgery respects biologic principles, preserves healthy tissues, enhances patient well-being, and maximizes soft tissue esthetics. Distributed into nine carefully sequenced chapters, this book first presents the minimally invasive philosophy before demonstrating the protocols necessary for the development of new skills for the surgeon, walking the reader through each phase of learning and practice required to advance to the next. Once this training is complete, the book reviews the basics of ergonomics, magnification, and subepithelial connective tissue grafting before moving on to the hallmark chapter on microsurgical techniques. This chapter comprises half the book and systematically presents each microsurgical technique, illustrating it step by step and then showcasing its use in multiple clinical case examples. Digital planning and suturing are emphasized, as well as esthetic microsurgery and the correlation of these techniques with implantology. The authors’ end goal is to equip clinicians to perform increasingly conservative, biologic, and predictable procedures with the greatest precision possible. 1,250 Illustrations.

    "description": "The full-arch implant rehabilitation (FAIR) protocol is one of the newest implant therapy innovations to treat the edentulous or nearly edentulous patient. The FAIR prosthesis is immediate, fixed, esthetically pleasing, highly functional, inexpensive, and maintainable, and it can frequently be installed without bone grafting. This book describes how the FAIR protocol works, who it should be used for, and methods to implement it successfully for different patients. The system can be used in both arches and in patients with total or near-total edentulism. Several chapters are devoted to describing step-by-step treatment with detailed clinical photographs documenting every step from initial assessment to prosthesis delivery. Even those new to fixed denture systems will find the procedures easy to follow and can begin implementing the FAIR approach for their patients.

    "description": "The replacement of the single tooth with a dental implant is one of the most common clinical situations practitioners face on a daily basis. While in the past sockets were left untouched for months after tooth extraction before attending to the residual ridge, today it is possible to perform one surgery, one time, which is a huge benefit to both the patient and clinician alike. Written by two world-class masters, this book begins with a discussion of the history and rationale for anterior and posterior single-tooth implants, and then it walks the reader through the three types of sockets-type 1, type 2, and type 3-and their various indications and limitations. An entire chapter is devoted to clinical management of posterior teeth, followed by a chapter on cementation and impression-making techniques and complications. The final chapter is a clinical case appendix detailing 11 cases of single-tooth replacement in all types of sockets previously described. The protocols showcased in this book will make patient care faster, easier, simpler, more predictable, and, in many cases, less costly. 1,117 illustrations Contents: History and Rationale for Anterior and Posterior Single-Tooth Implants Management of Type 1 Extraction Sockets Management of Type 2 Extraction Sockets Management of Type 3 Extraction Sockets Clinical Management of Posterior Teeth Important Considerations in Implant Dentistry Clinical Case Appendix [dflip id=”8872″ ][/dflip] You might also like Advanced Periodontal Treatment – Anton Sculean $129.99 Download Course Sale!

    "description": "All orthodontic treatment modalities can be improved by the application of sound biomechanics, yet most orthodontic therapy today is delivered without consideration of forces or force systems. Orthodontic hardware itself is only a means to an end point, such as tooth alignment, bone remodeling, or growth modification; the orthodontist can achieve these goals only by manipulating forces, regardless of the techniques used. Written by a world-renowned authority on the subject, this book teaches biomechanics in an easy-to-understand and engaging way, using universal examples outside orthodontics to illustrate basic force systems and how they function and then applying these principles to the practice of clinical orthodontics. The authors cover all of the force systems an orthodontist needs to understand to deliver effective treatment, explaining how each can be controlled and manipulated and demonstrating the forces at work through highly instructive 3D illustrations. Most chapters conclude with the presentation of several study problems, allowing the reader an opportunity to practice developing treatment plans using the biomechanical concepts discussed in each chapter. (Answers are provided at the end of the book.) This book is sure to be an instant classic. [dflip id=”8608″ ][/dflip] You might also like Sale!

    "description": "As research proceeds on treatment of the resorbed posterior maxilla, new techniques and innovations continue to be adopted to solve this clinical problem. While the previous edition of this book provided detailed information on the types of grafting materials and procedures available at the time, this completely revised version looks to the future with new strategies for treatment, some of which avoid grafting altogether. This book not only reviews the time-tested lateral window approach for sinus elevation and grafting but also describes a variety of techniques to approach the sinus transcrestally with or without grafting material. One section of the book is devoted entirely to the different types of implants and implant placement techniques available, many of which are designed specifically to avoid sinus elevation. In addition to clinical case studies and descriptions of how to perform specific surgical procedures, this book includes discussions on the science of bone formation and how continued research brings us closer every day to the ultimate goal of using tissue engineering to completely regenerate new teeth. 948 illustrations Contents Section I: Surgical Options for Bone Grafting 1.

    "description": "In the author’s bestselling first book, Vertical and Horizontal Ridge Augmentation: New Perspectives, published by Quintessence in 2017 and translated into 12 languages, the guided bone regeneration (GBR) technique was described in detail. This new publication, Vertical 2: The Next Level of Hard and Soft Tissue Augmentation, is a continuation of that book but at a more advanced level. Now, the author delves into the details where the devil lives, and shares information that has never been revealed before on the topic of vertical ridge augmentation. It is important to read this book armed with the knowledge from the first book as you will need it on this second journey with him. A major part of this book comprises full-color, step-by-step images of patient cases. At times, reading it is like watching a surgical video, where the author ‘stops the video’ to discuss with you, the reader, what he is thinking and doing at that step, what his next step will be, and the reason for it. Included again are the well-appreciated ‘Lessons learned’ sections, where the learning objectives are emphasized and further notes given, including ways to further improve the techniques. The section on the mandible is more detailed in this book, with the focus on larger defects and the different surgical steps in native, fibrotic, and scarred tissue types around the mental nerve during flap advancement. In addition, light is shed on the detail in treating the anterior maxilla, which has not been published previously. It includes treatment options such as the fast track, the safe track, and the technical track of soft tissue reconstruction in conjunction with bone grafting as well as papilla reconstructions after bone regeneration. The section on the posterior maxilla hopes to resolve issues such as the management and complications of combined ridge and sinus grafting, including difficulties such as the lack of buccal, crestal or nasal bony walls of the posterior maxilla before bone grafting. In this must-have new publication, the procedures are kept simple, repeatable, and biologically sound. The techniques presented are not overcomplicated; they are simple treatment strategies with lower complication rates and more predictability in the final outcome.

    "description": "Porcelain laminate veneers (PLVs) have been the most successful minimally invasive indirect prosthodontic application of esthetic dentistry in the last few decades. When designed and delivered properly, PLVs are the most sparkling, natural-looking manmade (and now digitally designed) form of esthetic dentistry. This book was written to help the esthetic dentist in treating unesthetic alignment, color, shape, or form of the teeth – in other words, enhancing the smile while enforcing function and occlusion. The main idea is to propose a common thread around guided, predictable dentistry and the use of veneers as a versatile restoration tool. The atypical format and original style of this book encourage the reader to think like an architect but act like a dentist to achieve ideal results. Rather than bog the reader down in text, this book uses hundreds of pristine photographs, many full-page, to guide the reader through each carefully chosen recipe, focusing on both cosmetic dentistry and reconstruction of worn dentitions.

    "description": "This book takes a comprehensive look at the state of implant dentistry today, equipping beginners and seasoned clinicians alike to improve their skills and practice implant dentistry safely and predictably. The early chapters focus on the biology of dental implants as well as medical considerations required prior to placing them, followed by chapters dedicated to documentation, treatment planning, and digital workflow. Surgical concepts are then described in detail, from single-tooth extraction to guided All-on-X treatment, followed by detailed discussion of the prosthetic options available in implant dentistry. The final chapters include relevant topics such as soft tissue management in implant dentistry, treatment of peri-implant disease, the socket shield technique, and marketing of dental implant therapy. Written by experienced clinicians from all over the world, the book includes over 60 surgical and clinical videos (linked via QR codes) to demonstrate what the procedures and techniques and products look like in real life, not in a photograph taken in ideal conditions, so readers can be confident in their understanding. This is the perfect book for clinicians looking to incorporate dental implants into their practice or learn the latest in the field from the experts.

    "description": "This two-volume set describes new criteria for esthetic restorative dentistry based on biomimetics. The first edition of this book took the dental world by storm in 2002 and became one of the bestselling Quintessence books of all time, and this edition will no doubt do the same. The book takes the science of esthetic dental reconstruction to a new level, both clinically and academically, and offers all that a clinician could wish for in terms of indications and the classic clinical steps for tooth preparation, laboratory and CAD/CAM procedures, adhesive luting procedures, and maintenance. But above all, what makes this book so unique is the underlying principle by which Pascal Magne lives: respect the natural structure and use that nature as your guide in restoration. The central philosophy of the book is the biomimetic principle—that is, the idea that the intact tooth in its ideal hues and shades, and perhaps more importantly in its intracoronal anatomy and location in the arch, is the guide to reconstruction and the determinant for success. Restoring or mimicking the biomechanical, structural, and esthetic integrity of teeth is paramount. Therefore, the objective of the book is to propose new criteria for esthetic restorative dentistry based on biomimetics. The driving forces of restorative dentistry are maintenance of tooth vitality and maximum conservation of intact hard tissues, and as such the book offers ultraconservative treatment options that can precede a more sophisticated treatment. The core of the book centers on the application of the biomimetic principle in the form of bonded restorations using composite resins and ceramics. The broad spectrum of indications of bonded restorations is described, followed by detailed instruction on the treatment planning and diagnostic approach, which is the first step for every case. The treatment is then described step by step, including tooth preparation and impression, laboratory and CAD/CAM procedures related to the fabrication of composite resin and ceramic workpieces, and their final insertion through adhesive luting procedures. Volume 1 covers the fundamentals and basic procedures, and Volume 2 focuses on advanced clinical techniques, maintenance, and repair of bonded restorations. QR codes throughout link to demonstrations of the techniques and dramatic videos highlighting the artistry of biomimetics. Written by a true master and true artist, this book will undoubtedly inspire excellence in anyone who picks it up. Contents Volume 1 Chapter 1. Understanding the Intact Tooth and the Biomimetic Principle Chapter 2. Natural Oral Design Chapter 3. Ultraconservative Treatment Options Chapter 4.

    "description": "Mastering Occlusion: A Simplified Approach for Predictable Treatment Occlusion is often reduced to the routine “tap, tap, and grind” of articulating paper marks that dentists perform daily. While appointments may be filled with fillings, crowns, bridges, or extensive fixed prosthodontics, occlusion frequently takes a backseat until the very end, when it’s time to address those red marks. However, there are times when a patient’s current bite can hinder necessary treatments, necessitating the construction and transfer of a new occlusion to the lab. This book is designed to clarify those complexities, guiding you through the process of determining whether to rely on a patient’s comfort in maxillomandibular position or to apply scientific principles for establishing the physiologic relationship. How can you effectively capture this new occlusion for the lab? Key Features: A simplified concept of occlusion that promotes predictable and successful treatment Two comprehensive parts: Part 1: Guiding principles and a streamlined model of occlusion Part 2: Specific scenarios encountered in diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care Author Michael Radu provides clear explanations and relatable analogies, making the principles of occlusion accessible and applicable to your daily practice—ultimately benefiting your patients. With 210 illustrations, this book is an invaluable resource for enhancing your understanding and application of occlusion. Contents Why Do We Need Occlusion? Practical Principles of Occlusion The Occlusion Formula There Are Only Two Bites Clinical Techniques and Principles of Interocclusal Recordings Techniques for Examination and Treatment Planning Techniques for Interocclusal Registration of an Existing Occlusion Techniques for Interocclusal Registration for a New Occlusion Techniques for Equilibration of the Occlusion Techniques for Recording the Envelope of Function Techniques for Communicating with the Laboratory Analog Versus Digital Techniques for Interocclusal Registration This book is essential for dental professionals aiming to refine their understanding of occlusion and improve treatment outcomes for their patients.

    "description": "With success rates ranging from 95% to over 98%, zygoma implants are the standard of care in the treatment of patients with severe maxillary bone atrophy who cannot be rehabilitated with surgical bone augmentation and/or the placement of conventional or tilted implants. Because patients who qualify as candidates for zygoma implant therapy usually get only one chance to regain their masticatory function, the stakes for this treatment are very high, and that is why Dr Arun K. Garg undertook this project. Written by distinguished authors with decades of clinical knowledge, the book equips the experienced implant surgeon with comprehensive knowledge of every facet of the surgical and prosthetic treatment protocols for zygoma implant therapy, from patient evaluation and selection to step-by-step procedures and the management of complications, building the reader’s knowledge from start to finish. Learn the ins and outs of zygoma implant therapy so you too can deliver this life-changing therapy to your patients. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase?

    "description": "There is no one way to approach immediate implant placement in molar sites, but each technique has the same prerequisites: careful case selection and planning, good working knowledge of anatomy and bone biology, expertise in localized and indirect sinus floor elevations, and knowing when and how to use particulate bone grafting. But even with such knowledge, clinicians still need guidelines to show them how to achieve predictable success. This book is that guide. It brings together clinical experts in the field who having been leading the research on immediate molar implants over the last decade and it describes the current best practices to ensure implant success. Emphasis is placed on assessment of the implant site, particularly regarding classification of the molar septum bone, and how to achieve optimal implant positioning within the molar socket. The role of digital treatment planning and guided surgery is discussed, as are application of bone grafts and other biomaterials to enhance healing. Immediate molar implants have become a more viable treatment option than ever before, and this book will help clinicians move forward with confidence.

    "description": "Immediate loading meets digital treatment planning in this latest implant title. The authors emphasize that the preservation of alveolar hard and soft tissues using the immediacy concept is more predictable than is the reconstruction of the hard and soft tissues using the traditional delayed approach once resorption has occurred. Immediate loading has also shown to be very predictable in cases of full-arch reconstructions and has become the treatment of choice in cases where appropriate criteria are met. Because a thorough understanding of analog protocols is necessary before attempting a digital case, the authors review these fundamental concepts to provide context for the transition to the digital realm. The book begins by outlining the principles of immediate loading and those of digital workflows before delving into individual clinical situations ranging from single teeth to full arches, both with and without bone resorption. Information on prosthetics is included as well as surgical treatment planning. The book concludes with a chapter entirely devoted to case presentations of all the treatment types covered throughout. If you are ready to step into the future of dental implant treatment, this book is for you! 1,153 illustrations.

    "description": "In our esthetics-obsessed culture, patients are becoming more aware and demanding of dermal filler treatments. Yet all too often we hear news stories of botched procedures or anesthesia gone wrong. This book walks you through how to incorporate dermal fillers into your clinical armamentarium, starting with the basic characteristics of the materials and advancing to the injection techniques and clinical indications for their use. The author includes such fine detail as whether to use a needle versus a cannula and why you must understand the precise tissue layers of the face in order to effectively deliver this nuanced treatment. In step with its sister volume, Botulinum Toxin for Facial Harmony, the book focuses on facial analysis as a crucial step in determining appropriate treatment, a philosophy that is carried through the entire book. An entire chapter is devoted to clinical cases illustrating the various facial regions and their appropriate filler applications, clearly demonstrating how to use the techniques presented to optimize esthetics and facial harmony.

    "description": "Bone and soft tissue augmentation of the alveolar ridge is fairly unique in medicine, because true biologic regeneration of lost alveolar bone is achievable. With this book, the author makes a fine contribution to knowledge management and clinical judgment in this dynamic field. The book begins with the basics of jaw atrophy, biology of bone regeneration, and wound healing, as well as grafts and materials. Subsequent chapters cover standard augmentation techniques such as bone grafting and soft tissue management, fully explaining available augmentation techniques for even the most demanding surgeons. The final third of the book is dedicated to a clinical decision-making scheme for different situations, challenges in the esthetic region, posterior jaws, and fully edentulous ridges. The chapters are supplemented with step-by-step clinical cases that illustrate the respective topic in a clear and comprehensible way. The book aims to introduce general dentists to the field of bone and soft tissue augmentation. It also offers more experienced colleagues, including oral and maxillofacial surgeons, many practical tips, particularly with regard to complication management.

    "description": "Despite the many advances of contemporary dental research in biomaterials and tissue regeneration, no dental material can perfectly correspond to natural tooth. The authors of this dynamic atlas posit that it is the mastery of layering technique and not the material itself that is most important in recreating natural-looking restorations. This reference book uses over a thousand images to explore the stratification of natural tooth and demonstrate solutions for how to arrange layers of composite resin to recreate the color, opacity, shape, and surface abnormalities of natural tooth. The authors provide step-by-step instruction in basic layering techniques as well as in advanced applications of dental characteristics, which are possible with a wide range of esthetic dental materials. In addition, each chapter is prefaced with insights from luminaries in esthetic dentistry, including Luiz Narciso Baratieri, Galip Gürel, Pascal Magne, Francesco Mangani, Ricardo Mitrani, and Angelo Putignano, among others. Optimal stratification techniques not only create natural-looking beauty in restorations but also imitate the innate bioarchitecture of teeth, which is the foundation of functional and esthetic results.

    "description": "Overview Among the many modalities developed to treat periodontal recessions, tunneling can be an overlooked approach that is minimally invasive and offers highly predictable and esthetic results. The author of this impressive monograph is educationally focused, basing the success of tunneling protocols on a deep understanding of the segmented surgical approach, a strict analysis of the crown-root transition zone, the use of novel belt and suspender sutures, and revised management of connective tissue grafts. Chapters are structured to help readers learn what they need to know to begin practicing this technique. Impressive case presentations showcase the versatility of the approach and demonstrate the variety of complex clinical situations it can address. This book will become the standard for learning tunneling protocols due to the meticulous presentation of material and the simple, rational decision trees that guide clinicians in establishing a clinical pathway where nothing is left to chance.

    "description": "The direct-indirect technique for composite resin veneer fabrication brings together many of the distinct advantages of the direct and indirect techniques. A direct-indirect restoration is one in which the composite resin is sculpted directly on the tooth structure without previous adhesive preparation, light activated, removed from the tooth, heat tempered, finished and polished extraorally, and finally adhered indirectly in the mouth in a single appointment. The resulting restoration exhibits improved mechanical properties, excellent esthetics, and unrivaled marginal adaptation and polishing. One of the most significant advantages of this technique is the possibility to modulate the final color of the restoration with luting agents, allowing for minor modifications in the restoration hue, chroma, and value. Furthermore, the direct-indirect technique has a wide range of applications, including prepless contact lenses and veneers, veneers with preparation (discolored teeth), fragments, diastema closure, and noncarious cervical lesions, among others. This book systematically covers these many applications and provides step-by-step protocols with specific layering strategies for each. Fifteen detailed case studies are included to showcase the technique in various clinical scenarios, highlighting the materials used and the type of composite veneer selected in each situation. Written by world-renowned masters in their field, this book will surely help to elevate your esthetic outcomes.

    "description": "Dental Implant Placement and Bone Grafting: A Comprehensive Guide Dental implant placement often necessitates bone grafting to provide the essential support for successful implants. The biological conditions of each patient—such as the extent of bone atrophy and the status of remaining teeth—can dictate the need for additional procedures like bone harvesting or sinus grafting. This book serves as an all-encompassing resource, delving into the biology of bone and the mechanics of dental implants within that context. It meticulously covers the various techniques for bone harvesting and how to augment sites for implant placement. Key features include: An exploration of different types of bone grafts and membranes Strategies for preserving the alveolar ridge following tooth extraction Insightful discussions on the management of bone, emphasizing the importance of preservation over replacement Written by the pioneering Dr. Garg, this new edition reinforces his leadership in the field, offering cutting-edge insights and practices to ensure successful implant placements across diverse patient scenarios.

    "description": "All surgical disciplines that deal with the human face must rely on an exact knowledge of its highly complex topographic-anatomical relationships. This atlas provides a unique contribution to the study of facial anatomy in which readers are allowed to explore deeper into the anatomy as the layers are stripped away, one by one. This book features elaborate composite illustrations created in layers, starting from the skeleton and working out to the surface of the skin. CT scans are used for the skeletal template, MRI series depict the inner layers of the facial region, angiographs report the anatomy of the blood vessels, and photographs of anatomical specimens as well as a living model fill out the rest. The final products are anatomical images of hyper 3D clarity and arresting beauty. Significant landmarks, anatomical details, and clinically relevant groupings of nerves and blood vessels are the primary focus of each image series to preserve clinical relevance. Accompanying text and figure legends emphasize key points, but the focus is always on the vivid anatomical images. Contents 1.

    "description": "This volume consists of 14 chapters that describe the scientific basis and applications of guided bone regeneration in implant dentistry. Dentistry specialists from Brazil, Europe, Australia, and the US cover the development and fine-tuning phase of the technique; the biologic basis of bone regeneration and a scientific update on bone formation and remodeling; and clinical procedures associated with different indications of the guided bone regeneration technique, with indications, criteria for patient selection, the steps of the surgical procedure, and postoperative treatment. The book emphasizes incision technique and flap design; the selection, handling, and placement of barrier membranes; the combination of membranes with autogenous bone grafts and low-substitution bone fillers; and aspects of wound closure. This edition has new chapters on the molecular and cellular characteristics of autogenous bone chips and how they release various growth factors when put in a mixture of blood and physiologic and sterile saline, the hard and soft tissue alterations following tooth extraction, and the surgical and anatomical factors influencing the regenerative outcome of guided bone regeneration procedures.

    "description": "Facial esthetics has become one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. As the field continues to evolve and patients demand more and more of practitioners, it is clear that both the beginner as well as the advanced practitioner seek convenient, safe, and effective therapies, and this book provides just that. Written in collaboration with international experts from various fields of medicine, including basic scientists, clinician-scientists, experts in laser therapy and photography, as well as plastic surgeons and hair restorative surgeons, this book collectively offers a comprehensive approach to using platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in facial esthetics. PRF has been used for decades in regenerative medicine, and slowly it has made its way into the medical esthetic arena, often used in combination with other leading therapies to support minimally invasive esthetic procedures. This book therefore starts at the beginning, first exploring the biology and anatomy of the skin and hair before turning to a discussion of photographic record-keeping and patient consultation. Then follow chapters on the biology of platelet concentrates and microneedling, skin and hair regeneration, lasers, and the use of PRF in plastic surgery. The final chapter looks to the future and considers what else could be possible. If you perform any facial esthetic procedures in your office or want to learn how, this book is a must. About the Author Catherine Davies, MBBCh, MBA, is a medical doctor practicing in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a special interest in esthetics, regenerative medicine, and hair restoration.

    "description": "Each chapter of this highly practical guide begins with a question-and-answer section that addresses clinicians’ most frequently asked questions: Why are pink esthetics the most important factor in determining a good treatment outcome? When is immediate postextraction implant placement preferable, and when is it safer to carry out preservation or augmentation of the ridge? When and how can a keratinized tissue band be properly reconstructed or peri-implant soft tissues be augmented? How are peri-implant esthetic complications treated? Citing from the literature, the authors review the prevailing best evidence to provide guidelines for treatment. With more than 90 clinical cases demonstrating a wide range of therapeutic needs, the authors explore compelling case examples to provide step-by-step analysis of techniques and explain the best treatment options in different clinical scenarios.

    "description": "Orthodontic treatment generally aims to improve the occlusion and smile esthetics of the patient. But the patient’s overall facial appearance determines how they look to others, not just their smile. This book dives deep into dentofacial esthetics and teaches you how to evaluate each patient who walks through your door from the macro to the micro, focusing first on the big picture and then working your way to the minute details in order to treatment plan for the best possible outcome. The author’s mantra is that “If you don’t see it, you won’t treat it,” so his goal is to educate dentists and orthodontists about what they should be seeing in order to yield maximally esthetic outcomes, taking into consideration concepts like esthetic balance and smile projection. This book will teach you to see the face and dentition in a different way, guiding you to understand what the problems are, how to think your way through them and put them in a perspective so that you and the patient can agree on the focus of treatment, and then how to choose the most appropriate and effective treatment methods. An invaluable resource for any orthodontist or esthetic dentist. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase? Right after checkout we email you a secure download link.

    "description": "Cephalometrics has been used for decades to diagnose orthodontic problems and evaluate treatment. However, the shift from 2D to 3D radiography has left some orthodontists unsure about how to use this method effectively. This book defines and depicts all cephalometric landmarks on a skull or spine in both 2D and 3D and then identifies them on radiographs. Each major cephalometric analysis is described in detail, and the linear or angular measures are shown pictorially for better understanding. Because many orthodontists pick specific measures from various cephalometric analyses to formulate their own analysis, these measures are organized relative to the skeletal or dental structure and then compared or contrasted relative to diagnosis, growth, and treatment. Cephalometric norms (eg, age, sex, ethnicity) are also discussed relative to treatment and esthetics. The final chapter shows the application of these measures to clinical cases to teach clinicians and students how to use them effectively. As radiology transitions from 2D to 3D, it is important to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of each in diagnosis and treatment, and this book outlines all of the relevant concerns for daily practice. 338 illustrations Contents: Introduction to the Use of Cephalometrics 2D and 3D Radiography Skeletal Landmarks and Measures Frontal Cephalometric Analysis Soft Tissue Analysis A Perspective on Norms and Standards The Transition from 2D to 3D Cephalometrics: Understanding the Problems of Landmarks and Measures Cephalometric Airway Analysis Radiographic Superimposition: From 2D to 3D Growth and Treatment Predictions: Accuracy and Reliability Measuring Bone with CBCT Common Pathologic Findings in Cephalometric Radiology The Cost of 2D Versus 3D Radiology Clinical Cases Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase?

Guided by the philosophy of biomimetics, the authors combine sound biologic principles with an overriding respect for the natural intact tooth to achieve esthetic satisfaction with bonded porcelain restorations. Unlike traditional veneers, the approach described here draws upon the ideal hues, the subtle shades, and especially the intracoronal anatomy of the intact tooth to serve as a guide to reconstruction and as a measurement of success. From this perspective, a checklist of fundamental esthetic criteria is presented, and treatment planning, diagnostics, tooth preparation, laboratory procedures, adhesive luting procedures, and maintenance protocols are carefully detailed.

Success goes beyond the operator’s skills in preparation and cementation; it demands a higher level of mastery in working with diverse restorative materials to achieve the desired outcomes. By meticulously following these procedures, clinicians can confidently advance to more complex cases. The knowledge gained from fabricating a single restoration can be applied to the rehabilitation of multiple teeth, albeit with increased challenges. Understanding the significance of a thorough preparation phase is crucial for making successful impressions, as is respecting the limitations of impression materials. Mastery of ceramic veneers is essential, as once the procedure is completed, rectifications are not possible. Gaining experience in these minimally invasive restorations requires dedicated training. Ultimately, it is the clinician’s responsibility to fulfill the needs and wishes of the patient while preserving as much natural tooth structure as possible, all while achieving optimal functional and esthetic results.

    "description": "Endodontic treatment generally has high success and survival rates, but like any discipline, complications can occur at any time—during diagnosis and treatment planning, access preparation, cleaning and shaping, obturation and restoration, as well as nonsurgical or surgical treatment. Ideally, the best way to manage potential errors is to have strategies in place to prevent them and eliminate risks, but equally importantly, clinicians must be able to diagnose and manage errors when they do occur. Based on decades of experience performing root canal treatment, these endodontic leaders explain their systematic approach for gathering pertinent medical and dental information, performing necessary tests, and analyzing the information to make informed decisions. This book guides readers through common errors and risk factors, recommendations for preventing mishaps, and methods to manage these challenges so clinicians can ultimately achieve results that provide long-term comfort, function, and esthetics for the patient. From diagnosis to prognosis, this book has you covered at any stage of endodontic treatment. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase?

Written by arguably the best orthodontist in the world and his periodontist colleague of almost 40 years, this text covers the various types of impactions an orthodontist and surgeon will encounter, including maxillary central incisors, maxillary canines (both labially and palatally impacted), mandibular canines, premolars, and mandibular molars. Each chapter focuses on a specific impacted tooth and how it can be surgically uncovered and orthodontically moved. The book also presents a chapter on failed cases, explaining what went wrong and how to prevent such negative outcomes when treating similar cases. Ideal for any dental practitioner who treats impacted teeth, this comprehensive and up-to-date book is a fitting legacy for Dr Kokich, whose impact within the field of orthodontics will be felt for years to come.

Readers will find step-by-step protocols, valuable insights, and helpful tips, backed by the best available scientific evidence. After explanation of the biological rationale for PET, the socket shield technique, which entails partial extraction of the tooth root prior to implant placement, is clearly described and illustrated. Guidance is then provided on case selection, contraindications, and fabrication and design of the provisional restoration. Variations in the PET procedure are explained, and techniques presented for the management of multirooted teeth, pontic sites, and full mouth rehabilitation. Advice is also offered on how to deal with complications and treatment failures. Finally, the current evidence for PET and the scope for extending its use are reviewed. PET has gained immense popularity in recent years, and this book will be of value for clinicians, students, and academicians. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase?

    "description": "Nowadays single-retainer metal-ceramic and all-ceramic resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses (RBFDPs) often present a minimally invasive alternative to single-tooth implants or other conventional prosthetic methods. With a growing body of evidence showing that implants placed in the esthetic zone of younger patients present a high risk of esthetic problems in later years, RBFDPs made from zirconia ceramics are experiencing a great renaissance. This book details the protocols necessary to achieve success when replacing incisors with single-retainer RBFDPs. Although the method is technically sensitive, it is simple and extremely reliable when the correct procedures are implemented. The principles outlined in the text can also be used to replace canines and premolars. Numerous high-quality figures detail the procedures for metal-ceramic and all-ceramic RBFDPs, and case presentations-some with 20 years and more of follow-up-document the development of the success model for RBFDPs. This comprehensive text will benefit practitioners who want to expand their minimally invasive treatment options for esthetic single-tooth replacement. 888 illustrations Contents: 1. Why RBFDPs went into single retainers 2. When single-retainer RBFDPs are meaningful 3. When single-retainer RBFDPs (alone) are not meaningful 4. Excellent longevity of single-retainer RBFDPs 5. Advantages and disadvantages of single-retainer RBFDPs 6. When RBFDPs should bond durably 7. Adequate diagnosis and treatment planning are essential 8. Pretreatment is of utmost importance 9. Metal-ceramic RBFDPs-Concise 10. All-ceramic RBFDPs-Detailed 11. To splint or not to splint-That is the question 12. Replacement of canines and premolars 13. After-care: Prevent problems-Solve problems 14. What you have to do to make it go wrong-The 10 most common mistakes in the application of RBFDPs 15.

    "description": "Practical Oral Surgery Skills Elevate Your Dental Practice with Essential Oral Surgery Techniques Practical oral surgery skills—such as tooth removal, plastic surgery, surgical tooth removal, tooth-preserving surgery, soft tissue surgery, and implant surgery—are often overlooked in dental school education or are only taught at the postgraduate level. However, these skills are crucial for every dentist to perform the basic procedures in general dental practice confidently and competently. This book focuses exclusively on the fundamental oral surgical procedures that are necessary for daily practice in the dental office. Each clinical chapter is systematically organized into indications, contraindications, specific risks, local anesthesia, step-by-step clinical procedure, wound care and closure, and postoperative controls. The text is supplemented by a selection of relevant literature references. The true strength of this book lies in its rich array of images and embedded videos, accessible via QR codes for viewing on smartphones or tablets. This combination aims to enhance the confidence of students, early-career professionals, and practitioners before, during, and after oral surgical interventions.

    "description": "Though comprehensive diagnosis and treatment planning set the stage for effective orthodontic treatment, it is a clear understanding of the fundamental biomechanical principles behind orthodontic force that allows the clinician to design the most favorable appliances and systems. Correct application of the principles of biomechanics leads to highly efficient and successful orthodontic treatment; a lack of proper understanding produces ineffectual systems that may even lead to collateral tissue damage. In addition, knowledge about the properties of the latest wire, bracket, and bonding materials and designs is a key factor in the configuration of successful orthodontic appliances. This essential book introduces students of orthodontics to the evolution of orthodontic technology and the properties of orthodontic materials, and outlines the essential mechanical principles behind successful orthodontic treatment.

The aim is to present the latest knowledge on the important contribution that orthodontic modalities can now make in the management of a disorder that has generally been the preserve of sleep doctors. This book comprises three parts of general understanding of OSA and medical approaches, orthodontic diagnostic process, and orthodontic treatment application. In particular, the treatment parts are subdivided into six chapters depending on the patient’s phenotype and age groups. The readers will come to realize how many modalities are available beyond the previously well-known options, and how important orthodontic contributions are for the treatment of OSA patients. The book will be an excellent resource providing well-organized diagnostic and therapeutic protocols from orthodontic point of view and will also be of value to other practitioners with an interest in OSA.

    "description": "In dentistry today, heavy focus is given to learning the techniques of fixed or implant-supported restorations at the expense of learning how to make removable dentures. As a result, many talented clinicians lack the training and experience necessary to provide functional and dependable complete denture therapy to their patients, even when this could be the best treatment option for certain patients. This book seeks to solve that problem, taking the reader step by step through the process of fabricating removable complete dentures from the very first appointment through impressions, delivery, and maintenance. Sections alternate between clinical and laboratory steps (color coded for quick reference), and technical aspects of denture making, such as master cast fabrication and baseplate and occlusal rim formation, are covered in detail for clinicians who choose to perform them in-house rather than outsourcing to a laboratory. With sections devoted to jaw and occlusion evaluation, how to determine the appropriate occlusal scheme, and more, the book seeks to empower clinicians to improve their patients’ quality of life. Focus is also given to delivery and subsequent adjustment, followed by maintenance of existing dentures and determining when a new denture is needed. From start to finish, this book supplies everything you need to provide functional and esthetic dentures for your patients. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase?

    "description": "New and innovative biomaterials are being discovered or created in laboratories at an unprecedented rate, but many of them remain entirely foreign to practicing clinicians. This book addresses this gap in knowledge by summarizing some of the groundbreaking research performed to date on this topic and providing case examples of these biomaterials at work. The book begins with a review of the biologic background and applications of bone grafting materials utilized in dentistry. The principles of guided tissue and bone regeneration are covered in detail, including many recent advancements in barrier membrane technologies as well as use of platelet-rich fibrin and various growth factors, and many next-generation materials that will optimize future bone and periodontal regeneration are presented. The final chapter is designed to help clinicians select appropriate biomaterials for each specific regenerative protocol. Much like one implant size and shape cannot be utilized for every indication in implant dentistry, one bone grafting material, barrier membrane, or growth factor cannot maximize regenerative outcomes in all clinical situations. This textbook teaches clinicians how to utilize biomaterials in an appropriate, predictable, and evidence-based manner. 960 illustrations Contents: 1.

The book captures the endodontics of the past, the endodontics of now, its trends, and the endodontics of the future. It illustrates the changes in endodontic technologies: from evolutionary history to the preparation of a correct access cavity, cleaning and shaping and 3D filling, from interdisciplinary endodontics to post-endodontic restoration, no detail comes up omitted in describing treatment methods necessary for clinical success. Volume I: Laying the Foundation Volume I sets the stage by laying the foundation of the endodontic discipline and enables the reader to understand literally every current endodontic Cleaning and Shaping method with superb illustrations covering every technique detail. Volume II: Comprehensive Obturation Volume II shows the Obturation method and focus into what matters in endodontics complete in a way that the reader can easily grasp and immediately apply to their practice. Diagnosis, cleansing and shaping and, subsequently, the three-dimensional obturation of the root canals are the most critical aspects of endodontics. The chapters dedicated to these topics are exhaustive as well as the chapter on endoparodontal relationships and on the influence that the two pathologies have on each other. The orthograde and surgical retreatments chapters make the text still more current and practical, as well as the new chapters on three-dimensional radiology and on pulp regeneration.

    "description": "This evidence-based book, featuring contributions from world-renowned experts, discusses in detail the functional anatomy of the temporomandibular joint as well as the aetiology, diagnosis, treatment and medicolegal implications of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).Despite advances in our understanding of the aetiology of TMD and in developing current treatment rationales, a number of issues remain controversial. These include the extent to which the temporomandibular joint should be a central focus of orthodontic diagnosis and treatment, as well as the role that occlusion and malocclusion play in precipitating TMD symptoms. Indeed, few subjects in dentistry and the specialty of orthodontics are open to as many interpretations or misinterpretations as TMD. This textbook provides clinical orthodontists with essential information and guidance that will assist them in understanding and effectively managing this complex multilayered problem. Throughout, clear clinical guidelines are presented on the basis of current scientific and clinical evidence. TMD and Orthodontics will be a highly valuable chairside resource for orthodontists everywhere. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase?

New technologies, including 3D diagnosis enabled by CBCT, are analyzed for their effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, important complications are discussed within the context of their causes and management; the author does not shy away from presenting examples of implant therapy with unsatisfactory results, valuing the instructive worth of problematic or controversial cases.

    "description": "Although conventional endodontics accounts for the majority of typical endontic practice, the rise of the operating microscope (OM) has brought elements to endontic surgery that were previously lacking–magnification, illumination, and visualization–and, along with new biomaterials, an increased range of solutions where the clinician can predictably preserve the tooth. Based in Leòn, Spain, Merino has some 15 years of experience in endodontic microsurgery and has lectured extensively in his country and internationally on the topic. His text provides both the general dentist and the specialist with in-depth, step-by-step information on the latest technology, strategies, biomaterials and instruments for microsurgical endodontic and immediate transplantology. All procedures are well described, with clear graphics and high-quality clinical illustrations. Oversize: 8.5×11.25″.

    "description": "Cervical dentin hypersensitivity (CDH) and noncarious cervical lesions (NCCLs) are common findings in modern clinical practice. Although research has shown that NCCLs are a multifactorial condition involving the three mechanisms of stress, biocorrosion, and friction, few dentists know how to treat them effectively. Similarly, CDH has been an enigma for many years, and research has focused on etiology instead of treatment. In addition, little attention has been given to their mutual etiologic mechanisms of cervical stress concentration from occlusal loading and endogenous/exogenous biocorrosion. Therefore, this book approaches CDH and NCCLs together and outlines the history, mechanisms, and, most important, the clinical methods of treatment for these pathologies. It is about time we as dentists learn how to treat and prevent these conditions in clinical practice. This involves greater diagnostic effort and alteration of treatment protocols to (1) reduce dietary intake/exposure to acids, (2) manage reflux diseases, and (3) consider the significance of occlusal therapies. After reading this book, the student or clinician will be able to diagnose and treat clinical cases of NCCLs and CDH. Contents Part I Introduction 1. History, Prevalence, and Etiology of NCCLs and CDH 2. Anatomical Considerations: Enamel, Dentin and Periodontium Part II Mechanisms of Action 3. Friction 4. Stress 5. Biocorrosion Part III Diagnosis and Treatment 6. Morphologic Characteristics of NCCLs 7. Clinical Analysis and Diagnosis of CDH and NCCLs 8.

    "description": "Orthodontics is a specialized branch of dentistry that focuses on dental and facial irregularities as well as their diagnosis, prevention and treatment. The goal of orthodontic treatment is to correct misaligned teeth and jaws, in order to improve oral function and aesthetics. Some of the prominent issues which are treated within this area of dentistry are crowded teeth, crooked teeth, overbites, underbites and gaps between teeth. Orthodontic treatment involves the use of various appliances to gently move teeth into their proper positions over time, using implements such as braces and aligners. By correcting dental and facial irregularities, orthodontic treatment improves chewing efficiency, speech, and self-confidence. It also facilitates better oral hygiene, reducing the risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and other dental problems. This book unfolds the innovative aspects of orthodontics which will be crucial for the progress of this field in the future. It will provide comprehensive knowledge to the readers.

    "description": "This unique book is a serious study of clinical endodontics that underscores the biologic foundation of endodontic treatment and seeks to bridge the gap between basic endodontic knowledge and advanced endodontic biology. Written by a well-established clinician and a researcher with extensive background in endodontic microbiology, this book combines invaluable histologic illustrations of endodontic disease with a robust clinical text that (1) describes the pathologies affecting dental tissues as well as their reactions to the clinical procedures and (2) uses clinical microbiology to explain the observed phenomena. Treatments of complex endodontic infections are presented for both vital and nonvital pulp therapy, and the influence of periradicular pathology are addressed in detail. Moreover, the authors wade into controversial topics with detailed and comprehensive analysis, including the implications of lateral canals on treatment and the causes of treatment failures and how to avoid them. The purpose of this book is to improve endodontic treatment, and the authors demonstrate how an in-depth knowledge of endodontic infections can help clinicians to synthesize the data from patient examinations in order to visualize what has taken place, understand the processes at work, and predict what will occur with the patient. An essential clinical text for comprehensive endodontic study. Scanned Searchable Copy Author(s): Domenico Ricucci / José F.

    "description": "In this beautifully illustrated volume, the author encourages readers to understand natural tooth forms through simple observation in order to create dental restorations that look natural in the context of the mouth, face, personality, and age of the specific patient being treated. The author focuses on the morphologic characteristics of teeth and their relationship to the surrounding structures, such as the lips and gingiva. The text also examines the tooth surface at the micro and macro levels and how its effects on light reflection can change the appearance, size, and morphology of teeth. All the phenomena and optical properties that must be understood and re-created in restorations in order to achieve lifelike results are analyzed, and a classification based on the shape and contour of the tooth is presented. Clinical cases provide practical application of these concepts.

    "description": "The provision of high-quality treatment with good aesthetic outcomes and shorter treatment times are important goals for all practising orthodontists. To facilitate these objectives, the availability of aesthetic appliances with low friction levels together with the introduction of orthodontic mini-screws have allowed faster and more efficient treatment with reduced side effects. The use of contemporary aesthetic appliances and mini-screws also negates the problems seen regarding patient compliance – which can be particularly problematic with adolescents and adults who are reluctant to use head-gear and traditional intra-oral devices. Authored by experts of international renown, Contemporary Orthodontics: Self-Ligating Appliances, Mini-Screws and Second Molars Extraction addresses these issues and is lavishly illustrated to clearly describe the diagnosis and treatment planning of Class II and III malocclusion and the use of second molar extraction. The book particularly explores the use of the Clarity™ Self-Ligating appliance, a device which contains all of the essential features of SmartClip™ but which – by possessing improved aesthetic properties – also demonstrates greater patient acceptability and hence improvement in compliance. Contemporary Orthodontics: Self-Ligating Appliances, Mini-Screws and Second Molars Extraction is ideal for practicing orthodontists both qualified and in training.

    "description": "Implant dentistry is a branch of dentistry that uses dental implants to restore missing teeth. Dental implants refer to artificial tooth roots made of biocompatible materials that are surgically placed into the jawbone to provide a strong foundation for replacement teeth or dental prostheses. This field combines principles from various fields such as oral surgery, prosthodontics, and implantology. The process of implant dentistry involves several stages. The first stage is an evaluation to study the patient’s oral health and suitability for dental implants. Following, the surgical stage takes place where the implant is placed into the jawbone through a surgical procedure. The implant then integrates with the surrounding bone through a process called osseointegration. After the osseointegration period, the restorative phase of implant dentistry begins. This involves the placement of an abutment, which connects the implant to the replacement tooth or dental prosthesis. This book unravels the recent studies on implant dentistry. It will serve as a valuable source of reference for graduate and postgraduate students. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase?

    "description": "In the specialty of orthodontics, treatment results depend on the clinician’s knowledge, manual dexterity, philosophy, and effort. This book highlights the lack of common scientific guidelines in orthodontic practice, advocating for the recognition and identification of such guidelines that work to place the teeth in positions that will produce the healthiest, most functional, most esthetic, and most stable results possible. With so many factors influencing long-term stability, this book consolidates the 20 principles of the Alexander Discipline outlined in volume one into 6 guidelines for approaching long-term stability in orthodontics, focusing on the periodontium, torque control, skeletal and transverse control, occlusion, and the soft tissue profile. Each guideline is presented with several case studies that follow from the treatment plan to the definitive result and that highlight long-term stability in 5- to 40-year posttreatment records. This is a must-have for the practicing orthodontist. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase? Right after checkout we email you a secure download link.

    "description": "Comprehensive and easy-to-understand, Foundations of Periodontics for the Dental Hygienist, 4th Edition offers up-to-date, evidence-based coverage of periodontal anatomy, the periodontal disease process, and classifications of periodontal disease. Rather than presenting information in narrative style, the author, a leading expert in the field, uses a detailed outline format, making the information easier to read, understand, and reference. The Fourth Edition has been revised and updated throughout, continues its focus on the hygienist’s role in periodontal therapy, and adds a number of new features designed to help students apply what they are learning to clinical patient care situations. Five Comprehensive Patient Cases —two brand-new to this edition—include clinical photos, radiographs, and periodontal charts to help students develop practice skills as they apply and integrate content from the entire book to patient periodontal care planning. An easy-to-use, easy-to-reference outline format makes it easy for readers to identify, learn, and review key concepts. Hundreds of full color illustrations and clinical photographs visually reinforce chapter content. A Focus on Patients feature asks readers to apply chapter content in the context of clinical periodontal care. New chapter-opening Clinical Patient Care features spell out the relevance of chapter content to patient care. Evidence-based content is integrated throughout, ensuring the most current, reliable information. New Evidence in Action features assist students in applying current evidence-based research findings to clinical patient care. New Ethical Dilemmas features help students apply the difficult concept of legal/ethical issues to the patient care setting. Learning Objectives and Key Terms provide a “road map” to module topics and help students master a whole new dental vocabulary. A complete online audio glossary provides quick access to common periodontal terminology and pronunciation. Frequently Asked Questions How do I access the PDF after purchase?

This book presents the structural biologic foundations underpinning dental and oral medicine. Beginning with an overview of the anatomy of the mouth and moving on to the evolution of the oral structures and pre- and postnatal development of the oral cavity, related facial structures, and the teeth, this book describes each part of the orofacial region in terms of its morphology, tissue structure, cellular properties, and development. Functioning as both a textbook for dental students and a reference manual for experienced clinicians, this compendium of the structural biologic foundations of clinical work in dental and oral medicine allows practitioners to integrate current research in molecular biology into a solid framework of knowledge.

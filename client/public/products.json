In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

The journal is pre-eminent in oral medicine. Oral Diseases specifically strives to link often-isolated areas of dentistry and medicine through broad-based scholarship that includes well-designed and controlled clinical research, analytical epidemiology, and the translation of basic science in pre-clinical studies. The journal typically publishes articles relevant to many related medical specialties including especially dermatology, gastroenterology, hematology, immunology, infectious diseases, neuropsychiatry, oncology and otolaryngology. The essential requirement is that all submitted research is hypothesis-driven, with significant positive and negative results both welcomed. Equal publication emphasis is placed on etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention and treatment.\nISSN: 1354-523X\nJournal Archive 2010 to 2022\nVolume 16 To 28 ; Full Issues",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

    "description": "P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration\nP.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.\nThe course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.\nIn particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.\nLanguage: Italian with English Subtitles\nPresented By: Paolo Casentini\nCourse Details: 34 Videos – Duration: 24 hours & 19 min – File size: 18.6 GB",

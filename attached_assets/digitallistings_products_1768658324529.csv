PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

PGR – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration (Italian Language with English Subtitles),$500.00 Original price was: $500.00.$199.00Current price is: $199.00.,"P.G.R. – Prosthetically Guided Regeneration
P.G.R. is the acronym for Prosthetically Guided Regeneration and represents a working philosophy that places the prosthetic outcome as the fundamental driver of the entire regenerative treatment plan.
The course opens with 4 theoretical lessons illustrating the core principles of prosthetically guided regeneration, and is completed by a series of clinical cases—each including a theoretical introductory presentation, analysis of the treatment plan, and surgical ReLive—aimed at showing the extreme flexibility and adaptability of the P.G.R. approach across different clinical scenarios. In an engaging and strongly practical learning pathway, Paolo Casentini demonstrates how P.G.R. makes it possible to achieve excellent aesthetic results, major benefits in terms of time, and simplification in the treatment of complex cases.
In particular, the course illustrates the application of P.G.R. protocols in multidisciplinary treatment in the aesthetic area, with defects involving hard and soft tissues and previous errors in implant positioning, cases of severe ankylosis, synergies between P.G.R. and mucogingival aesthetic surgery, conditioning and improvement of soft tissues, post-extraction implant placement, and the use of three-dimensional regenerative supports such as mesh.

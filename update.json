    "description": "This two-volume set describes new criteria for esthetic restorative dentistry based on biomimetics. The first edition of this educational software took the dental world by storm in 2002 and became one of the bestselling Quintessence resources of all time, and this edition will no doubt do the same. The resource takes the science of esthetic dental reconstruction to a new level, both clinically and academically, and offers all that a clinician could wish for in terms of indications and the classic clinical steps. The semi-hardcover format makes this a robust and handy guide.",
